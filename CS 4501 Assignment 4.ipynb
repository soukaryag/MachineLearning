Whereas the traditional training took on the scale of hours, this was done in about twenty seconds and got to testing in that time with nearly as good of a accuracy score. I believe if I were to invest the time, I could easily get it to cross 0.897. This is because DNN's are inherently better at these classification tasks. The complexity and intracacy of the structure of the neural networks allow them to thrive in image classification.\n",

Then it added He initialization along with ELU and Adam optimization and this boosted the score by a few percentage points. The difference was not staggering since the first model already performed decently.  But in terms of best models, it got a lot closer to that ceiling of 0.897 of non-neural networks model.\n",

However, for the amount of work I did, I think my model performs much better than I could have ever dreamed of. Having only put in about four hours of work to build a SVM to classify these images would not have gotten me anywhere near this success rate."
